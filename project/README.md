## üîß Technical Implementation

### SMS Detection Methods

#### 1. Native SMS API (Android WebView)
```javascript
// Listen for incoming SMS
navigator.sms.addEventListener('received', handleSMS);
```

#### 2. Service Worker Background Sync
```javascript
// Periodic SMS checking
self.addEventListener('periodicsync', (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'check-sms') {
    checkForSMS();
  }
});
```

#### 3. WebSocket Connection
```javascript
// Real-time SMS from server
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-server.com/sms');
ws.onmessage = (event) => handleSMS(event.data);
```

### Location Services
```javascript
// Automatic location when emergency detected
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  (position) => {
    // Send location to emergency services
    sendEmergencyAlert({
      latitude: position.coords.latitude,
      longitude: position.coords.longitude
    });
  }
);
```

### Emergency Notifications
```javascript
// Send to multiple services
await emergencyNotificationService.sendEmergencyAlert({
  type: 'accident',
  location: currentLocation,
  message: 'Emergency detected',
  severity: 'critical'
});
```

## üìã API Integration

### Emergency Services API
```javascript
// Send emergency alert
POST /api/emergency-alert
{
  "type": "accident",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 40.7128,
    "longitude": -74.0060
  },
  "message": "Emergency detected",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "severity": "critical"
}
```

### SMS Service (Twilio)
```javascript
// Send SMS to emergency contacts
await twilioClient.messages.create({
  body: emergencyMessage,
  to: contact.phone,
  from: 'your-twilio-number'
});
```
